git checkout - switch between branch
git checkout -b [name_new_branch] [id_commit] - creating new branch
git diff - when we have file in status modified, show edit with this file
git branch -D [name_branch] - delete branch

for MERGE branch_1 with branch_2 we have to follow in branch_2 and writing: 'git merge branch_1'
